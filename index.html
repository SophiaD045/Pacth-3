                <h2>Intertextuality</h2>
                <div class="intro">
                    <p>Intertextuality is important to consider when reading Latin poetry. Many poems derive inspiration and are influenced by poems preceding them. The poems <em>Heroides 15</em> and the <em>Cento</em> of Proba are deeply intertextual, in differing ways, and readers benefit from knowing the contexts behind their influences. <em>Heroides 15</em>, written by Ovid, is a love elegy from the perspective of Sappho to Phaon, who is her lover in this poem. There are influences and references from Sappho’s own poetry, and from Catullan poetry as well. The <em>Cento</em> of Proba directly pulls from the Bible and from Virgil’s works. The intertextuality of these poems is both made by choice and by the standards of the time. Romans who were very traditional, would take inspiration from those that came before them.[1] Text is not read in isolation and that is true for both <em>Heroides 15</em> and for Proba’s <em>cento</em>. Reading them in isolation without intertextual contexts and knowledge would dull their meanings and effectiveness as poems. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="ovid">
                    <h3>Ovid's <em>Heroides 15</em></h3>
                    <p>It is important to consider the fact that Ovid is writing a female experience through a male lens. Unlike previous works of Ovid where the men speak with deception, the women are writing with honesty instead.[2]  The other <em>Heroides</em> poems focus on mythical characters, Sappho is a real person however which makes this interesting.  Sappho was a Greek poet, and to keep in the style Ovid had chosen to have some words that are more Greek in form, such as names. Even the choice to make the <em>Heroides</em> a series of elegies is intertextual. The choice of the elegy allows for the focus on the lover, and the point of view of the woman writing the love letter is shown to a greater extent.[3]  Ovid turns the restrictions of the normal Roman elegiac structure into a narrative convention.[4]</p>
                    <p>Sappho is known for her love poetry and for how it portrays same-sex desire. Ovid, knowing this seems to shun her same sex desire from her own poetry and within his own poem writes Sappho to be in love with a man. Knowing about Sappho and her poetry allows the reader to have a greater and more in-depth understanding of <em>Heroides 15</em>, such as when Ovid makes references back to Sappho’s own life and experiences which would most likely have been taken from Sappho’s own poetry.</p>
                    <p>The <em>Heroides</em> contain many references to myth, and <em>Heroides 15</em>5 is no different. Such as in lines 23 – 24 where Ovid names Apollo and Bacchus: </p>
                    <blockquote><em>Sume fidem et pharetram: fies manifestus Apollo.</em></blockquote>
                    <blockquote><em>Accedant capiti cornua: Bacchus eris.</em> (Her. 15.23-24)</blockquote>
                    <p>Accept this lyre and quiver: you will unmistakenly become Apollo.</p>
                    <p>Let horns come near your head: you are Bacchus.</p>
                    <p>Knowing references to certain gods will allow the reader to better understand the symbolism associated with them. Apollo is associated with poetry and archery and Bacchus with the horn. Without an understanding of the symbols associated with the gods, there could arise confusion as to why these specific items are being written about and their relevance.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, Ovid portrays Sappho differently to from other women that he writes about. He writes her as being more in control of her own sexuality. This makes Sappho have a more ‘masculine’ voice within <em>Heroides 15</em>.[5]  There are a lot of Catullan influences specifically in the <em>Heroides 15</em>, which makes it a unique case as “Catullus pays frequent homage to Sappho, and Ovid frequent homage to Catullus.”[6] Judith Hallet goes more in-depth into the masculinization of Sappho and its intertextual relations to a couple of Catullus’ poems. </p>
                    <p>There are small intertextual relations to Catullus and larger ones as well. A smaller one would be from line:</p>
                    <blockquote><em>Lesbi puella, vale!(Her. 15.100)</em></blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Maiden from Lesbos, farewell!</blockquote>
                    <blockquote><em>Puella, vale!(Cat. 8.12)</em></blockquote>
                    <p>Maiden, farewell!</p>
                    <p>This references Catullus saying farewell to a woman, who is presumably Lesbia, which the name is also a reference back to Sappho who is from the island of Lesbos.[7]  Here Sappho is referring to herself in the third person, telling Phaon that he will bid farewell to her, and Ovid is attempting to connect his version of Sappho to Catullus’ Lesbia. This could also contribute to the masculinization of Sappho by giving her a line which Catullus had written and speaking in the third person as if she were the male in the situation. </p>
                    <p>Ovid also makes intertextual connections to his own poetry. Connecting <em>Heroides 15</em> to his Amores and Tristia. Judith brings attention to lines 79-80 in <em>Heroides 15</em> and connects them to Amores 2.4 and Tristia 4.10:</p>
                    <p>Although this does also bring into question the authorship of this elegy. However, despite the issue of the authorship the intertextual connections are still present but with different intent behind it.[8] If it was Ovid then it is possible that he wished to make connections to previous works and if it was an author attempting to imitate Ovid then it is likely that that this was done in order to sound more Ovidian in writing. Intention is an important aspect of intertextuality, as although some connections may be unintentional, the choice to include an intertextual connection is key to understanding what the author is attempting to convey through the use of intertextuality.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="proba">
                    <h3>Proba's <em>Cento</em></h3>
                    <p>The <em>Cento</em> of Proba is an interesting poem as nearly all lines are intertextual in some way.[9]  The word <em>cento</em> also means ‘patchwork’, a type of poem where it draws sentences and phrases from other texts to create a new one.[10]  Many lines take from Virgil’s <em>Aeneid</em> or the <em>Georgics</em> and the Bible, which if the reader has knowledge of Virgil and the Bible allows them to have a more in-depth understanding on what Proba wishes to speak about and where she is drawing her lines from. This was the earliest Virgilian <em>cento</em> which had a Christian theme.[11]  Normally, intertextual readings of poems focus on certain allusions or references towards other texts where they are more sparsely spaced out, but with a text so deeply intertextual as a <em>cento</em>, an intertextual reading will be different. There is a much greater focus on each line and whether it is Proba’s own words or if it had been taken from the works which the <em>cento</em> is a patchwork of. </p>
                    <p>The beginning of Proba’s <em>Cento</em> brings together Pagan and Christian traditions, by invoking God for inspiration.[12]  Invoking the Muses for inspiration in poetry was commonly done in Latin poetry, and also in Greek poetry. Although she is beginning her poetry in the same fashion, she continues to describe that she does not partake in any Pagan beliefs, such as seeking “ambrosian drink”, but only in Christian ones.[13]  Proba also directly takes from Virgil’s <em>Georgics</em> in line 22:</p>
                    <blockquote><em>Hinc canere incipiam (Cent. 22)</em></blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Here I start to sing</blockquote>
                    <p>This sets the tone for the rest of her <em>Cento</em>, that it is Virgilian in nature while also changing the opening of the <em>Georgics</em> to be about Christ, <em>munera Christi</em>(Cent. 22).[14] </p>
                    <p>Proba in the beginning of her <em>Cento</em> focuses on the events within the Book of Genesis in the Bible, and reorganizes the events “according to Greco-Roman literary accounts of the creation of the universe.”[15]  Lines from Virgil’s <em>Georgics</em> are heavily used throughout the creation scene in Proba’s <em>Cento</em>. Cullhead brings special attention to a description of Spring within the <em>Georgics</em> and relates it to the creation of the universe.[16] She directly uses lines from Virgil such as: </p>
                    <blockquote><em>origine mundi inluxisse dies aliumve habuisse tenorem crediderim</em></blockquote>
                    <blockquote>I believe to be true that the origin of the world was illuminated over different days.</blockquote>
                    <p>There are a multitude of instances where Proba connects events from the Bible and relates then to events that occurred during the <em>Aeneid</em> or the <em>Georgics</em>. Sigrid Schottenius Cullhead brings attention to the story of Adam and Eve and the connections made to it within Proba’s <em>Cento</em>. Proba takes from the story of Dido and Aeneas to tell the story of Adam and Eve. An example of this is in the phrase <em>claraque in luce refulsit</em>(Cent. 130) (Aen. 1.588), gleaming in bright light, where originally it shows Dido’s passion for Aeneas that was brought about by Venus. This could also foreshadow the events that happen because of Eve, both women are introduced basked in light and later meet tragedy.[17]</p>
                    <p>Cristalle Watson highlights the use of types and anti-types, and typology within the <em>cento</em>, where a figure in Virgil’s works has a counter part within the Christian Bible.[18]  For example, Jesus is compared to a multitude of figures including Aeneas, Hercules, and Aeneas’ father. The use of Virgilian types with Christian anti-types forces the reader to “consider the latter in terms of the former” in order to create a deeper understanding of the figures.[19] Those who are familiar with these figures in the Virgilian texts are then able to connect to the Biblical figures even without much prior knowledge of said figures. </p>
                    <p>Yet again, intent is important when considering an intertextual reading of a text. Proba’s <em>Cento</em> has the intent of Christianizing Virgil. Taking Virgil’s poetry and interpreting it through a Christian lens is what I believe to be Proba’s intention. Surrounding the time in which this <em>cento</em> was written, Rome was becoming more and more Christian. Using Virgil’s works would have been an innovative way to keep tradition and yet also adapt to the changing religious climate within Rome at the time.</p>

                    <h3>Benefits and Disadvantages of Intertextual Readings</h3>
                    <p>Downsides to reading poems with intertextuality could include the fact that if a reader is not familiar with the other texts and authors which the poems are influenced by could lead to confusion or misunderstandings of the works. Without prior knowledge of Sappho or Catullus, <em>Heroides 15</em> would lose some of its details, and even reading it in isolation from other <em>Heroides 15</em> works could also leave out details of the elegy and its effectiveness. </p>
                    <p>Without prior knowledge of Virgil’s works, mainly the <em>Aeneid</em> and the <em>Georgics</em>, Proba’s <em>Cento</em> would lose much of its meaning due to a <em>cento</em> being deeply intertextual piece of work. Although the text is still able to be mostly understood by the average reader, having the added knowledge of Virgil’s works allows for a deeper understanding of Proba’s <em>Cento</em>, its details and what she wishes to portray.</p>
                    <p>Authorship has been questioned in relation to <em>Heroides 15</em>, whether it had been written by Ovid or another author impersonating him. This is important to take into account, as it does change the intertextuality of the text. If it was indeed written by Ovid then many of the allusions and intertext made were intentional to create more depth and for stylistic choices. However, if the author was not Ovid, then there is extra intention in ensuring that the intertextuality of the elegy was Ovidian in nature so that it could pass as having been written by Ovid. </p>
                    <p>Benefits to reading a piece of text intertextually are that alongside a deeper understanding of the poem and its details, the reader is also able to take into account the political and social influences surrounding the poem.[20]  The use of intertext within Latin poetry can be considered to be “the very process of cultural exchange and appropriation in action.”[21]  This can be seen in Ovid taking from Sappho’s Greek poetry and Catullus’ Latin poetry in order to create his <em>Heroides 15</em>, and in Proba’s <em>Cento</em> where she uses Virgil to tell Christian stories. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="conclusion">
                    <p>Intertextuality is important to consider when reading Latin poetry including <em>Heroides 15</em> and Proba’s <em>Cento</em>. Intertextuality brings more context and depth to the poems, which without them could possibly confuse the reader. Although there are some challenges when reading intertextually, the benefits outweigh the negatives when it comes to Latin poetry especially due to the culture surrounding them. Poetry is not created in isolation, and intertextuality allows for the reader to connect with the cultures, societies, and politics surrounding a poem creating a more profound understanding of both the author and the text. These poems were made with intertextual references intentionally. To discard the intertextual connections would be to take away the details and contexts surrounding the poems, would mean losing much of its meaning in the process. Reading these poems with an intertextual lens allows a reader more insight into the intentions of the poets, and the society they lived in.</p>
